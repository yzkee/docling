# 10-K MOUNTAIN LAKE ACQUISITION CORP. 2025-12-31

None

We are a special purpose acquisition company with no business operations. Since our initial public offering, our sole business activity has been identifying and evaluating suitable acquisition transaction candidates. Therefore, we do not consider that we face significant cybersecurity risk and have not adopted any cybersecurity risk management program or formal processes for assessing cybersecurity risk.

We depend on digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications and services, including those of third parties with which we may deal. Sophisticated and deliberate attacks on, or security breaches in, our information systems or infrastructure, or the information systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud, could lead to corruption or misappropriation of our assets, proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. Because of our reliance on the technologies of third parties, we also depend upon the personnel and the processes of third parties to protect against cybersecurity threats. In the event of a cybersecurity incident impacting us, the management team will report to the board of directors and provide updates on the management team's incident response plan for addressing and mitigating any risks associated with the cybersecurity incident. As an early-stage company without significant investments in data security protection, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to adequately protect against, or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to, cyber incidents. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have adverse consequences on our business and lead to financial loss.

As of the date of this Report, we have not identified any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that we believe have, or are likely to, materially affect us since our initial public offering.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Mountain Lake Acquisition Corp. (the "Company") as of December 31, 2025 and 2024, and the related statements of operations, changes in shareholders' deficit, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2025 and for the period from June 14, 2024 (inception) through December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2025 and for the period June 14, 2024 (inception) through December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

**NOTE 1 - DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS**

Mountain Lake Acquisition Corp. (the "Company") is a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on June 14, 2024. The Company was incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses that the Company ("Business Combination"). The Company may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any industry or geographic location.

As of December 31, 2025, the Company has not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from June 14, 2024 (inception) through December 31, 2025, relates to the Company's formation and the initial public offering ("Initial Public Offering"), which is described below, and subsequent to the Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for a Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of a Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company generates non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end.

The registration statement for the Company's Initial Public Offering was declared effective on December 12, 2024. On December 16, 2024, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 23,000,000 units (the "Units" and, with respect to the shares of Class A ordinary shares included in the Units sold, the "Public Shares"), which includes the partial exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 2,000,000 Units, at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $230,000,000, which is described in Note 3. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 805,000 private placement units (each, a "Private Placement Unit") at a price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit in a private placement to Mountain Lake Acquisition Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Sponsor"), and BTIG, representative of the underwriters ("BTIG"), generating gross proceeds of $8,050,000, which is described in Note 4.

Transaction costs amounted to $13,354,261, consisting of $4,600,000 of cash underwriting fee, $8,050,000 of deferred underwriting fee and $704,261 of other offering costs. On October 1, 2025, the Company amended the Underwriting Agreement. As a result on the amendment, the Company reversed $7,050,000 deferred underwriting fee payable, resulting in a $1,000,000 outstanding balance on deferred underwriting fee payable reported on balance sheets.

The Company's management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of its Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. The Company's initial Business Combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding any deferred underwriters fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time the Company signs a definitive agreement in connection with the initial Business Combination. However, the Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.

Upon the closing of the Proposed Public Offering, management has agreed that an amount equal to at least $10.05 per Unit sold in the Proposed Public Offering, including the proceeds of the Private Placement Units, will be held in a trust account ("Trust Account") with Continental Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company acting as trustee and invested in United States "government securities" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below.

Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on December 16, 2024, an amount of $231,150,000 ($10.05 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units, and a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Units, was placed in the Trust Account with Continental Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company acting as trustee. The funds will be held in cash, including in demand deposit accounts at a bank, or invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below.

The Company will provide its holders of the Public Shares (the "Public Shareholders") with the opportunity to redeem, regardless of whether they abstain, vote for, or against, a Business Combination, all or a portion of their Public Shares upon either (i) the completion of the initial Business Combination or an earlier redemption in connection with the commencement of the consummation of the initial Business Combination if the Company determines it is desirable to facilitate the completion of the initial Business Combination, (ii) the redemption of the Public Shares if the Company is unable to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below), subject to applicable law, or (iii) the redemption of the Public Shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (A) to modify the substance or timing of the obligation to allow redemption in connection with the initial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of the Public Shares if the Company has not consummated an initial Business Combination within the Combination Period or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders' rights or pre-initial business combination activity.

All of the Public Shares contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the liquidation, if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the initial Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (the "Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association"). The Public Shares were recorded at redemption value and classified as temporary equity at the completion of the Initial Public Offering, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 480, "Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity."

Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the holders of the Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) prior to the Initial Public Offering (the "Initial Shareholders") have agreed to vote their Founder Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination. In addition, the Initial Shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and Public Shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination. In addition, the Company has agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial Business Combination without the prior consent of the Sponsor.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company's Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association provides that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a "group" (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% or more of the Class A ordinary shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, without the prior consent of the Company.

The Sponsor, executive officers, and directors have agreed, pursuant to a letter agreement, that they will not propose any amendment to the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (A) to modify the substance or timing of the Company's obligation to redeem 100% of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders' rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares.

If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering or during any extended time that the Company has to consummate a Business Combination beyond 18 months as a result of a shareholder vote to amend the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (the "Combination Period"), the Company will, but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Shareholders' rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any) subject to the Company's obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law. In such event, the rights will expire and be worthless.

In connection with the redemption of 100% of the Company's outstanding Public Shares for a portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, each holder will receive a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account, plus any pro rata interest earned on the fund held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses).

The Initial Shareholders have agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Initial Shareholders should acquire Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Company's Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be only $10.05 per share initially held in the Trust Account. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.05 per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.05 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable; provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company's indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have vendors, service providers (except the Company's independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.

***Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern***

As of December 31, 2025, the Company had $452,680 in cash and a working capital surplus of $265,230. Further, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans.

In connection with the Company's assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") ASC Topic 205-40, "Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern", as of December 31, 2025, the Company lacks the financial resources it needs to sustain operations for a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be one year from the date of the issuance of the financial statements. The Company cannot ensure that its plans to raise capital or to consummate an initial Business Combination will be successful. In addition, Management has determined that if the Company is unable to complete an initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, then the Company will cease all operations except for the purpose of liquidating. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management plans to consummate an initial Business Combination prior to the mandatory liquidation date. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after June 16, 2026.

NOTE 2- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

***Basis of Presentation***

The accompanying financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") and pursuant to the accounting and disclosure rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").

***Emerging Growth Company***

The Company is an "emerging growth company," as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the "JOBS Act"), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.

Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised it has different application dates for public or private companies. The Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company's financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

***Use of Estimates***

The preparation of the financial statement in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.

Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statement, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.

***Cash and Cash Equivalents***

The Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company had $452,680 and $1,383,392 in cash and no cash equivalents as of December 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

***Cash and Marketable Securities Held in Trust Account***

As of December 31, 2025 and 2024, the assets held in the Trust Account, amounted to $241,230,572 and $231,643,853, respectively. The Company classifies its U.S. Treasury and equivalent securities as held to maturity in accordance with ASC Topic 320, "Investments - Debt and Equity Securities." Held-to-maturity securities are those securities which the Company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity. Held-to-maturity treasury securities are recorded at amortized cost on the accompanying balance sheets and adjusted for the amortization or accretion of premiums or discounts. When the Company's investments held in the Trust Account are comprised of money market securities, the investments are classified as trading securities. Gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of these securities are included in interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account in the accompanying statements of operations. The estimated fair values of investments held in the Trust Account are determined using available market information.

***Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption***

The Public Shares contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company's liquidation, or if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Company's initial Business Combination. In accordance with ASC 480-10-S99, the Company classifies Public Shares subject to redemption outside of permanent equity as the redemption provisions are not solely within the control of the Company. The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and will adjust the carrying value of redeemable shares to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Immediately upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company recognized the accretion from initial book value to redemption value. The change in the carrying value of redeemable shares will result in charges against additional paid-in capital (to the extent available) and accumulated deficit. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2025 and 2024, Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders' deficit section of the Company's balance sheets.

As of December 31, 2025 and 2024, the Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption reflected in the balance sheets are reconciled in the following table:

| Gross proceeds                                                            |    | $   | 230,000,000   |    |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----|-----|---------------|----|
| Less:                                                                     |    |     |               |    |
| Proceeds allocated to Public Share Rights                                 |    |     | (2,070,000    | )  |

| Plus:                                                                     |    |     |               |    |
| Accretion for Class A ordinary shares to redemption amount                |    |     | 16,924,324    |    |

| Plus:                                                                     |    |     |               |    |
| Accretion for Class A ordinary shares to redemption amount                |    |     | 9,586,719     |    |
| Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption, December 31, 2025 |    | $   | 241,230,572   |    |

***Fair Value of Financial Instruments***

The fair value of the Company's assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC Topic 820, "Fair Value Measurement," approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying balance sheets, primarily due to their short-term nature.

***Fair Value Measurements***

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for sale of an asset or paid for transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include:

|    | ●   | Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in active markets;                                                                                                                                                                       |
|----|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    | ●   | Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and           |
|    | ●   | Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. |

In some circumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

***Offering Costs***

The Company complies with the requirements of the ASC 340-10-S99 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A, "Expenses of Offering." Offering costs consist principally of professional and registration fees that are related to the Initial Public Offering. FASB ASC 470-20, "Debt with Conversion and Other Options," addresses the allocation of proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt into its equity and debt components. The Company applies this guidance to allocate Initial Public Offering proceeds from the Units between Class A ordinary shares and rights, using the residual method by allocating Initial Public Offering proceeds first to assigned value of the rights and then to the Class A ordinary shares. Offering costs allocated to Public Shares were charged to temporary equity, and offering costs allocated to share rights included in the Public and Private Placement Units were charged to shareholders' equity (deficit) as the rights, after management's evaluation, were accounted for under equity treatment.

***Income Taxes***

The Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC Topic 740, "Income Taxes," which prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company's management determined that the Cayman Islands is the Company's only major tax jurisdiction. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. As of December 31, 2025 and 2024, there were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position.

There is currently no taxation imposed on income by the government of the Cayman Islands. In accordance with Cayman Islands federal income tax regulations, income taxes are not levied on the Company. Consequently, income taxes are not reflected in the Company's financial statements. The Company's management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months.

***Net Income per Ordinary Share***

The Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, "Earnings Per Share." The Company has two classes of ordinary shares, which are referred to as Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares. Income and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of ordinary shares. This presentation assumes a business combination as the most likely outcome. Net income per ordinary share is calculated by dividing the net income by the weighted average ordinary shares outstanding for the respective period.

The calculation of diluted net income per ordinary share does not consider the effect of the rights issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement to purchase an aggregate of 7,666,667 Class A ordinary shares in the calculation of diluted income per ordinary share, because their exercise is contingent upon future events. As a result, diluted net income per ordinary share is the same as basic net income per ordinary share for the year ended December 31, 2025 and for the period from June 14, 2024 (inception) through December 31, 2024. Accretion associated with the redeemable Class A ordinary shares is excluded from earnings per ordinary share as the redemption value approximates fair value.

The following table presents a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used to compute basic and diluted net income ordinary share for each class of ordinary shares:

|                                     |    | For the Year Ended  December 31,   |            |      |      |                          |           |    |    | For the Period from June 14, 2024  (inception) through  December 31,   |           |      |      |                          |           |    |
|-------------------------------------|----|------------------------------------|------------|------|------|--------------------------|-----------|----|----|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|------|------|--------------------------|-----------|----|

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution, which, at times, may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage limit of $250,000. Any loss incurred or a lack of access to such funds could have a significant adverse impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

Share Rights

The Company accounts for the Public and Private Placement Rights issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering and the private placement in accordance with the guidance contained in FASB ASC Topic 815, "Derivatives and Hedging". Accordingly, the Company evaluated and classified the rights under equity treatment at their assigned values.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.

***Basis of Presentation***

The accompanying financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") and pursuant to the accounting and disclosure rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").

***Emerging Growth Company***

The Company is an "emerging growth company," as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the "JOBS Act"), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.

Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised it has different application dates for public or private companies. The Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company's financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

***Use of Estimates***

The preparation of the financial statement in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.

Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statement, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.

***Cash and Cash Equivalents***

The Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company had $452,680 and $1,383,392 in cash and no cash equivalents as of December 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

***Cash and Marketable Securities Held in Trust Account***

As of December 31, 2025 and 2024, the assets held in the Trust Account, amounted to $241,230,572 and $231,643,853, respectively. The Company classifies its U.S. Treasury and equivalent securities as held to maturity in accordance with ASC Topic 320, "Investments - Debt and Equity Securities." Held-to-maturity securities are those securities which the Company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity. Held-to-maturity treasury securities are recorded at amortized cost on the accompanying balance sheets and adjusted for the amortization or accretion of premiums or discounts. When the Company's investments held in the Trust Account are comprised of money market securities, the investments are classified as trading securities. Gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of these securities are included in interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account in the accompanying statements of operations. The estimated fair values of investments held in the Trust Account are determined using available market information.

***Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption***

The Public Shares contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company's liquidation, or if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Company's initial Business Combination. In accordance with ASC 480-10-S99, the Company classifies Public Shares subject to redemption outside of permanent equity as the redemption provisions are not solely within the control of the Company. The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and will adjust the carrying value of redeemable shares to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Immediately upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company recognized the accretion from initial book value to redemption value. The change in the carrying value of redeemable shares will result in charges against additional paid-in capital (to the extent available) and accumulated deficit. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2025 and 2024, Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders' deficit section of the Company's balance sheets.

As of December 31, 2025 and 2024, the Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption reflected in the balance sheets are reconciled in the following table:

***Fair Value of Financial Instruments***

The fair value of the Company's assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC Topic 820, "Fair Value Measurement," approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying balance sheets, primarily due to their short-term nature.

***Fair Value Measurements***

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for sale of an asset or paid for transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include:

|    | ●   | Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in active markets;                                                                                                                                                                       |
|----|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    | ●   | Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and           |
|    | ●   | Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. |

In some circumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

***Offering Costs***

The Company complies with the requirements of the ASC 340-10-S99 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A, "Expenses of Offering." Offering costs consist principally of professional and registration fees that are related to the Initial Public Offering. FASB ASC 470-20, "Debt with Conversion and Other Options," addresses the allocation of proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt into its equity and debt components. The Company applies this guidance to allocate Initial Public Offering proceeds from the Units between Class A ordinary shares and rights, using the residual method by allocating Initial Public Offering proceeds first to assigned value of the rights and then to the Class A ordinary shares. Offering costs allocated to Public Shares were charged to temporary equity, and offering costs allocated to share rights included in the Public and Private Placement Units were charged to shareholders' equity (deficit) as the rights, after management's evaluation, were accounted for under equity treatment.

***Income Taxes***

The Company complies with the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC Topic 740, "Income Taxes," which prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company's management determined that the Cayman Islands is the Company's only major tax jurisdiction. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. As of December 31, 2025 and 2024, there were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position.

There is currently no taxation imposed on income by the government of the Cayman Islands. In accordance with Cayman Islands federal income tax regulations, income taxes are not levied on the Company. Consequently, income taxes are not reflected in the Company's financial statements. The Company's management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months.

***Net Income per Ordinary Share***

The Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, "Earnings Per Share." The Company has two classes of ordinary shares, which are referred to as Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares. Income and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of ordinary shares. This presentation assumes a business combination as the most likely outcome. Net income per ordinary share is calculated by dividing the net income by the weighted average ordinary shares outstanding for the respective period.

The calculation of diluted net income per ordinary share does not consider the effect of the rights issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement to purchase an aggregate of 7,666,667 Class A ordinary shares in the calculation of diluted income per ordinary share, because their exercise is contingent upon future events. As a result, diluted net income per ordinary share is the same as basic net income per ordinary share for the year ended December 31, 2025 and for the period from June 14, 2024 (inception) through December 31, 2024. Accretion associated with the redeemable Class A ordinary shares is excluded from earnings per ordinary share as the redemption value approximates fair value.

The following table presents a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used to compute basic and diluted net income ordinary share for each class of ordinary shares:

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution, which, at times, may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage limit of $250,000. Any loss incurred or a lack of access to such funds could have a significant adverse impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

Share Rights

The Company accounts for the Public and Private Placement Rights issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering and the private placement in accordance with the guidance contained in FASB ASC Topic 815, "Derivatives and Hedging". Accordingly, the Company evaluated and classified the rights under equity treatment at their assigned values.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.

NOTE 3 - INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING

Pursuant to the Initial Public Offering, on December 16, 2024, the Company sold 23,000,000 Units, which includes the partial exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 2,000,000 Units, at a price of $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share and one right. Each right entitles the holder thereof to receive one-tenth of one Class A ordinary share upon the consummation of an initial Business Combination.

NOTE 4 - PRIVATE PLACEMENT

Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor and BTIG purchased an aggregate of 805,000 Private Placement Units (495,000 Private Placement Units purchased by the Sponsor and 310,000 Private Placement Units purchased by BTIG), at a price of $10.00 per Private Placement Units from the Company in a private placement, generating gross proceeds of $8,050,000. A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Units was added to the net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Units held in the Trust Account will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law). The Private Placement Units are identical to the units sold in the Initial Public Offering.

NOTE 5 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Founder Shares

On June 27, 2024, the Sponsor made a capital contribution of $25,000 to cover certain expenses on behalf of the Company in exchange for issuance of 7,187,500 Class B ordinary shares (the "Founder Shares"). Subsequently, on December 12, 2024, the Company, through a share capitalization, issued an additional 359,375 Founder Shares to the Sponsor, resulting in an aggregate of 7,546,875 Founder Shares issued and outstanding. The holders of the Founder Shares agreed to forfeit and cancel up to an aggregate of 984,375 Founder Shares, on a pro rata basis, to the extent that the option to purchase additional Units is not exercised in full by the underwriters. The forfeiture will be adjusted to the extent that the option to purchase additional Units is not exercised in full by the underwriters so that the Founder Shares will represent approximately 23.2% of all of the Company's issued and outstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering. On December 16, 2024, the underwriters partially exercised their over-allotment option as part of the closing of the Initial Public Offering and forfeited their option to exercise the remaining over-allotment option. As such, 359,375 Founder Shares were forfeited.

With certain limited exceptions, the Founder Shares are not transferable, assignable or salable (except to the Company's officers and directors and other persons or entities affiliated with the Sponsor, each of whom will be subject to the same transfer restrictions) until the earlier to occur of (i) one year after the completion of the initial Business Combination or (ii) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction after the initial Business Combination that results in all of the shareholders having the right to exchange their Class A ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property; except to certain permitted transferees and under certain circumstances as described herein. Any permitted transferees will be subject to the same restrictions and other agreements of the Initial Shareholders with respect to any Founder Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (1) the closing price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share subdivisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the initial Business Combination or (2) if the Company consummates a transaction after the initial Business Combination which results in the shareholders having the right to exchange their shares for cash, securities or other property, the Founder Shares will be released from the lock-up.

Due to Sponsor

As of December 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company owed the Sponsor $688 and $3,183 in connection with the overfunding of the private placement, respectively, offset by the payments made on behalf of the Sponsor.

Related Party Loans

On June 27, 2024, the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company up to $200,000 (as amended to $300,000 on September 23, 2024) pursuant to a promissory note (the "Note"). The Note is non-interest bearing, unsecured and due on the earlier of December 31, 2024, the closing of the Proposed Public Offering, or the date the Company determines not to proceed with the Proposed Public Offering. On December 31, 2024, the Company repaid the total outstanding balance of the note amounting to $275,193. Borrowings under the note are no longer available.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor, members of the Company's founding team or any of their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required ("Working Capital Loans"). If the Company completes a Business Combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender's discretion, up to $1.5 million of such Working Capital Loans may be converted into units of the post-Business Combination entity at a price of $10.00 per Unit. The units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. As of December 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company had no borrowings under the Working Capital Loans.

Services Agreement

The Company agreed, commencing on the closing of Initial Public Offering through the earlier of consummation of the initial Business Combination and the liquidation, to pay the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the President and Chief Financial Officer, a total of up to $20,000 per month for their services as executive officers and directors of the Company. For the year ended December 31, 2025, the Company incurred and paid an expense of $240,000 of fees for these services. For the period from June 14, 2024 (inception) through December 31, 2024, no fees were incurred for these services.

NOTE 6 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Registration and Shareholder Rights

The holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Units (and underlying securities) and any Units (and underlying securities) that may be issued on conversion of Working Capital Loans are entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement requiring the Company to register such securities for resale. The holders of these securities will be entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form registration demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggyback registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of the initial Business Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. However, the registration rights agreement provides that the Company will not be required to effect or permit any registration or cause any registration statement to become effective until termination of the applicable lock-up period. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.

Underwriting Agreement

The underwriters had a 45-day option from the date of the Initial Public Offering to purchase up to an additional 3,150,000 units to cover over-allotments, if any. On December 16, 2024, simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the underwriters elected to partially exercise the over-allotment option to purchase an additional 2,000,000 Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit and forfeited their right to exercise the remaining over-allotment option.

The underwriters were paid a cash underwriting discount of $0.20 per Unit, or $4,600,000 in the aggregate. In addition, the underwriters are entitled to a deferred underwriting fee of $0.35 per Unit, or $8,050,000 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.

On October 1, 2025, the Company and representative of the underwriters thereunder (the "Representative") amended the Underwriting Agreement, effective and conditioned upon consummation of the Business Combination, by deleting Section 1.3 of the Underwriting Agreement and replacing it with the following: "1.3 Deferred Underwriting Commission. The Representative agrees that an aggregate amount equal to one million dollars ($1,000,000) (the "Deferred Underwriting Commission"), will be deposited and held in the Trust Account and payable in cash directly from the Trust Account, without accrued interest, to the Representative for its own account upon consummation of the Company's initial merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the "Business Combination"). In the event that the Company is unable to consummate a Business Combination and Continental, as the trustee of the Trust Account (in this context, the "Trustee"), commences liquidation of the Trust Account as provided in the Trust Agreement, the Representative agrees that: (i) the Representative shall forfeit any rights or claims to the Deferred Underwriting Commission, including any accrued interest thereon; and (ii) the Deferred Underwriting Commission, together with all other amounts on deposit in the Trust Account, shall be distributed on a pro-rata basis among the Public Shareholders. Any Deferred Underwriting Commissions shall be deemed fully earned by each Underwriter upon the payment of the purchase price for the Units purchased by such underwriter on the closing of the Offering (including payment of the purchase price of any Option Units) and will be paid only if and when the Company consummates its Business Combination." The Company and the Representative agree that any reference in the Underwriting Agreement to the amount owed for the Deferred Underwriting Commission that is inconsistent with the provisions of Section 1.3, as amended by this Paragraph 1, shall be deemed amended to be consistent with the provisions of Section 1.3, as amended by this Paragraph 1.

The amendment of the Underwriting Agreement shall apply only in connection with the Business Combination and shall not apply in connection with any Business Combination that may be contemplated or consummated between the Company and any party other than Avalanche Treasury Company, LLC or its affiliates. The parties agree that if the Business Combination is terminated for any reason, this Letter Agreement shall be void and of no effect for all purposes. As a result on the amendment above, the Company reversed $7,050,000 deferred underwriting fee payable, resulting to $1,000,000 outstanding balance on deferred underwriting fee payable reported on balance sheets.

Risks and Uncertainties

The United States and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the geopolitical instability resulting from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the recent escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict. In response to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ("NATO") deployed additional military forces to eastern Europe, and the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and other countries have announced various sanctions and restrictive actions against Russia, Belarus and related individuals and entities, including the removal of certain financial institutions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication payment system. Certain countries, including the United States, have also provided and may continue to provide military aid or other assistance to Ukraine and to Israel, increasing geopolitical tensions among a number of nations. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict and the resulting measures that have been taken, and could be taken in the future, by NATO, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Israel and its neighboring states and other countries have created global security concerns that could have a lasting impact on regional and global economies. Although the length and impact of the ongoing conflicts are highly unpredictable, they could lead to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain interruptions and increased cyberattacks against U.S. companies. Additionally, any resulting sanctions could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets and lead to instability and lack of liquidity in capital markets.

On July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the "OBBBA") was enacted into law in the United States. The significant provisions of OBBBA include the permanent extension and modification of certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was enacted in 2017, including international tax provisions and the restoration of favorable tax treatment for certain business provisions. The legislation has multiple effective dates, with certain provisions effective in 2025 and others implemented in later years. The Company is evaluating the provisions of OBBBA, but it is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.

Any of the above mentioned factors, or any other negative impact on the global economy, capital markets or other geopolitical conditions resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict, enactment of OBBBA and subsequent sanctions or related actions, could adversely affect the Company's search for an initial Business Combination and any target business with which the Company may ultimately consummate an initial Business Combination.

Business Combination Agreement

On October 1, 2025, the Company entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the "Business Combination Agreement") with Avalanche Treasury Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Pubco"), Avalanche SPAC Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Avalanche Company Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Avalanche Treasury Company LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "AT Company"), and Dragonfly Digital Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Seller"). The transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement are referred to as the "Proposed Business Combination." Concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company entered into a Sponsor Support Agreement with the Sponsor and Pubco (the "Sponsor Support Agreement"). In addition, the Sponsor agreed pursuant to the Sponsor Support Agreement to effect certain security cancellations and to deposit certain Pubco Class A Stock issued to it at the closing of the Proposed Business Combination (the "Closing") into escrow in connection with the Closing.

Concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, Pubco, the AT Company and the Company entered into subscription agreements (collectively, the "Company Unit Subscription Agreements") with certain investors (the "Company Unit Investors"), pursuant to which the Company Unit Investors agreed to purchase, payable in cash or USD Coin ("USDC"), unlocked AVAX or locked AVAX, and the AT Company agreed to issue and sell, approximately $274 million worth of Company Class A units (the "Subscribed Units") at a price of $10.00 per Subscribed Unit, in a private placement (the "Company Unit Subscription"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein. At the Closing, each Subscribed Unit held by Company Unit Investors will be converted automatically into one share of Pubco Class A Stock. Pursuant to the Company Unit Subscription Agreement, Pubco agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Pubco Class A Stock into which the Subscribed Units will be converted upon Closing to be registered with the SEC.

Concurrently with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement and the TSA (as defined below), the Seller, the AT Company, Pubco, Avalanche BVI and Avalanche Cayman (together with Avalanche BVI, the "Foundation"), entered into an asset sale and contribution agreement (the "Contribution Agreement"), pursuant to which, on the date of the Business Combination Agreement: (a) the Foundation agreed to sell a minimum of $200 million of AVAX tokens on a pre-discount basis to the AT Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in a Token Sale Agreement (the "TSA") by and between the Company and the Foundation, and (b) the Seller agreed to contribute, directly and indirectly through certain related funds, 1,960,040 AVAX tokens to the AT Company in exchange for 5,805,638 Company units.

For further details on the Proposed Business Combination, refer to the Current Reports on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC on October 7, 2025 and January 13, 2026.

NOTE 7 - SHAREHOLDERS' DEFICIT

***Preference Shares*** **-** The Company is authorized to issue 5,000,000 preference shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share. As of December 31, 2025 and 2024, there were no preference shares issued or outstanding.

***Class A Ordinary Shares*** **-** The Company is authorized to issue 445,000,000 Class A ordinary shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share. Holders of the Company's Class A ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share. At December 31, 2025 and 2024, there were 805,000 Class A ordinary shares issued or outstanding, excluding 23,000,000 Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption.

***Class B Ordinary Shares*** **-** The Company is authorized to issue 50,000,000 Class B ordinary shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share. Holders of the Class B ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share. At December 31, 2025 and 2024, there were 7,187,500 Class B ordinary shares issued and outstanding.

Only holders of Class B ordinary shares will have the right to vote on the election of directors prior to the Business Combination. Holders of Class A ordinary shares and holders of Class B ordinary shares will vote together as a single class on all other matters submitted to a vote of the Company's shareholders except as otherwise required by law. Ordinary shareholders of record are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by shareholders. Holders of Class A ordinary shares and holders of Class B ordinary shares will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders except as required by law.

The Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares concurrently with or immediately following the consummation of the initial Business Combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for share subdivisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like, and subject to further adjustment as provided herein. In the case that additional Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities are issued or deemed issued in connection with the initial Business Combination, the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all Founder Shares will equal, in the aggregate, 23.2% of the total number of Class A ordinary shares outstanding after such conversion (after giving effect to any redemptions of Class A ordinary shares by Public Shareholders and not including the Class A ordinary shares underlying the Private Placement Units), including the total number of Class A ordinary shares issued, or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by the Company in connection with or in relation to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, excluding any Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities or rights exercisable for or convertible into Class A ordinary shares issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial Business Combination and any Private Placement Units issued to the Sponsor, officers or directors upon conversion of Working Capital Loans, provided that such conversion of Founder Shares will never occur on a less than one-for-one basis.

Rights

Except in cases where the Company is not the surviving company in a Business Combination, each holder of a right will automatically receive one-tenth (1/10) of one ordinary share upon consummation of the initial Business Combination. The Company will not issue fractional shares in connection with an exchange of rights. Fractional shares will either be rounded down to the nearest whole share or otherwise addressed in accordance with the applicable provisions of Cayman law. In the event the Company is not the surviving company upon completion of the initial Business Combination, each holder of a right will be required to affirmatively convert his, her or its rights in order to receive the one-tenth (1/10) of one ordinary share underlying each right upon consummation of the Business Combination. If the Company is unable to complete the initial Business Combination within the required time period and the Company will redeem the public shares for the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of rights will not receive any of such funds for their rights and the rights will expire worthless.

NOTE 9 - SEGMENT INFORMATION

ASC Topic 280, "Segment Reporting," establishes standards for companies to report in their financial statement information about operating segments, products, services, geographic areas, and major customers. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is regularly evaluated by the Company's chief operating officer decision maker ("CODM"), or group, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.

The Company's CODM has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer , who reviews the operating results for the Company as a whole to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing financial performance. Accordingly, management has determined that the Company only has one reportable segment.

The CODM assesses performance for the single segment and decides how to allocate resources based on net income that also is reported on the statements of operations as net income. The measure of segment assets is reported on the balance sheets as total assets. When evaluating the Company's performance and making key decisions regarding resource allocation, the CODM reviews several key metrics, which include the following:

|                                                      |    | December 31,   | December 31,   |    |    | December 31,   | December 31,   |    |

The CODM reviews interest earned on marketable securities held in Trust Account to measure and monitor shareholder value and determine the most effective strategy of investment with the Trust Account funds while maintaining compliance with the trust agreement. General and administrative expenses are reviewed and monitored by the CODM to manage and forecast cash to ensure enough capital is available to complete a business combination within the business combination period. The CODM also reviews general and administrative expenses to manage, maintain and enforce all contractual agreements to ensure costs are aligned with all agreements and budget.

General and administrative expenses, as reported on the statements of operations, are the significant segment expenses provided to the CODM on a regular basis.

When evaluating the Company's performance and making key decisions regarding resource allocation, the CODM reviews several key metrics, which include the following:
