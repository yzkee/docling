    item-4 at level 2: caption: Table 1. HPO performed in OTSL and HTML representation on the same transformer-based TableFormer 9 architecture, trained only on PubTabNet [22]. Effects of reducing the # of layers in encoder and decoder stages of the model show that smaller models trained on OTSL perform better, especially in recognizing complex table structures, and maintain a much higher mAP score than the HTML counterpart.
