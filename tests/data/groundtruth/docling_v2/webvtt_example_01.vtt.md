We are in New York City

We’re actually at the Lucern Hotel, just down the street

from the American Museum of Natural History

And with me is Neil deGrasse Tyson

Astrophysicist, Director of the Hayden Planetarium

at the AMNH.

Thank you for walking down here.

And I want to do a follow-up on the last conversation we did.

When we e-mailed—

Didn’t we talk about enough in that conversation?

No! No no no no; 'cos 'cos obviously 'cos

*Laughs*

You know I’m so excited my glasses are falling off here.
