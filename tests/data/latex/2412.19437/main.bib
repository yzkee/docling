Instead of relying on traditional GPU programming models that emphasize data-parallel computations, warp specialization allows compilers like Singe to partition computations into sub-computations which are then assigned to different warps within a thread block. Fine-grain synchronization between warps is performed efficiently in hardware using producer-consumer named barriers. Partitioning computations using warp specialization allows Singe to deal efficiently with the irregularity in both data access patterns and computation. Furthermore, warp-specialized partitioning of computations allows Singe to fit extremely large working sets into on-chip memories. Finally, we describe the architecture and general compilation techniques necessary for constructing a warp-specializing compiler. We show that the warp-specialized code emitted by Singe is up to 3.75X faster than previously optimized data-parallel GPU kernels.},

TriviaQA includes 95K question-answer pairs authored by trivia enthusiasts and independently gathered evidence documents, six per question on average, that provide high quality distant supervision for answering the questions. We show that, in comparison to other recently introduced large-scale datasets, TriviaQA (1) has relatively complex, compositional questions, (2) has considerable syntactic and lexical variability between questions and corresponding answer-evidence sentences, and (3) requires more cross sentence reasoning to find answers. We also present two baseline algorithms: a feature-based classifier and a state-of-the-art neural network, that performs well on SQuAD reading comprehension. Neither approach comes close to human performance (23{\%} and 40{\%} vs. 80{\%}), suggesting that TriviaQA is a challenging testbed that is worth significant future study.",

    abstract = "Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) has become enormously popular recently and has attracted a lot of attention. However, the existing reading comprehension datasets are mostly in English. In this paper, we introduce a Span-Extraction dataset for Chinese machine reading comprehension to add language diversities in this area. The dataset is composed by near 20,000 real questions annotated on Wikipedia paragraphs by human experts. We also annotated a challenge set which contains the questions that need comprehensive understanding and multi-sentence inference throughout the context. We present several baseline systems as well as anonymous submissions for demonstrating the difficulties in this dataset. With the release of the dataset, we hosted the Second Evaluation Workshop on Chinese Machine Reading Comprehension (CMRC 2018). We hope the release of the dataset could further accelerate the Chinese machine reading comprehension research. Resources are available: \url{https://github.com/ymcui/cmrc2018}",
