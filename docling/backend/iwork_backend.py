"""Backends for Apple Pages (``.pages``) and Keynote (``.key``) documents.

Either file is a ZIP container, but what is inside changed completely with the
2013 releases:

* **Pages 5 / Keynote 6 and later (2013 onwards)** store the document as
  ``Index/*.iwa`` — Snappy-framed protobuf whose schemas Apple has never
  published. This is what essentially every iWork document in circulation looks
  like. Keynote 2018 and later flatten the package into a subdirectory and zip
  that index a second time, into an ``Index.zip``.
* **iWork '09 and earlier** stored it as plain XML — ``index.xml`` for Pages and
  ``index.apxl`` for Keynote, either of them optionally gzipped — alongside a
  ``QuickLook/Preview.pdf`` render that Apple stopped writing after that release.

Every generation is read into the same model, so the backends are declarative:
they build a :class:`~docling_core.types.doc.DoclingDocument` directly rather
than rendering pages and running layout analysis over them.
