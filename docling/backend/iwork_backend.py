"""Backends for Apple iWork documents.

Currently limited to Pages (``.pages``). A ``.pages`` file is a ZIP container, but
what is inside changed completely with Pages 5:

* **Pages 5 and later (2013 onwards)** store the document as ``Index/*.iwa`` —
  Snappy-framed protobuf whose schemas Apple has never published. This is what
  essentially every Pages document in circulation looks like.
* **iWork '09 and earlier** stored it as a plain ``index.xml``, optionally
  gzipped, alongside a ``QuickLook/Preview.pdf`` render that Apple stopped
  writing after that release.

Both generations are read for their text here, so the backend is declarative: it
builds a :class:`~docling_core.types.doc.DoclingDocument` directly rather than
rendering pages and running layout analysis over them.

Only body text is extracted. Heading levels, lists and tables are carried by the
paragraph style runs (IWA) and style attributes (XML) and are not yet mapped.
