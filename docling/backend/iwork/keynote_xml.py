"""Reader for the ``index.apxl`` of an iWork '09 (and earlier) Keynote document.

Keynote wrote a plain XML tree before 2013, in the ``key`` namespace over the
``sf`` one every iWork app shared, and it describes the same presentation the
modern container keeps in an object graph: a slide list, and a slide holding a
title placeholder, a body placeholder, presenter notes and a page whose layers
hold everything else.

Only the elements Keynote adds live here; the ``sf`` vocabulary underneath them
— runs, character and list styles, tables, placed images — is shared with the
other iWork apps and is read by :mod:`docling.backend.iwork.legacy`.
