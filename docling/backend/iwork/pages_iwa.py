"""Reader for the object graph of a Pages 5+ (2013 onwards) document.

The container is a set of ``Index/*.iwa`` archives whose schemas Apple has never
published, so what is read here is the object graph itself: a document archive
referencing a body text storage, run tables keyed by character index for
everything applied to that text, and drawables reached either from the
attachments anchored in the text or from the document's own list of them.

Only what ``TP``, Pages' own namespace, adds to a document lives here; the
``TSWP``, ``TST`` and ``TSD`` archives underneath it are shared with the other
iWork apps and are read by :mod:`docling.backend.iwork.archives`.
