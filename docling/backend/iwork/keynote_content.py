"""The content a Keynote presentation holds, however its container spells it.

A presentation is a list of slides rather than one flow of text, so it is
modelled here instead of reusing :class:`~docling.backend.iwork.content.Content`,
which a Pages document shapes itself to. What sits *on* a slide is the shared
model: the same paragraphs, tables and pictures, read by the same readers.

Both container generations store a slide's drawables in the order they are
drawn rather than the order they are read, so both need the same repair, and
:func:`reading_order` is here rather than in either reader.

    is measured against the previous drawable rather than the row's first, so a
