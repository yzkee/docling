    "In this example, we demonstrated:\n",

    "✅ How to configure Docling for offline XBRL parsing  \n",
    "✅ How to provide a local taxonomy for XBRL validation  \n",
    "✅ How to convert XBRL instance documents to DoclingDocument  \n",
    "✅ How to extract metadata, text blocks, and numeric facts  \n",
    "✅ How to export XBRL content to Markdown and JSON formats  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Offline operation**: By setting `enable_remote_fetch=False`, all processing happens locally\n",
    "- **Taxonomy support**: The local taxonomy directory should contain all necessary schema and linkbase files\n",
    "- **Structured extraction**: XBRL numeric facts are extracted as key-value pairs with graph representation\n",
    "- **Text blocks**: HTML text blocks in XBRL are converted to structured content\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on Future Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ The current implementation uses `DoclingDocument`'s `GraphData` object to represent key-value pairs. This design will change in a future release of the `docling-core` library."
